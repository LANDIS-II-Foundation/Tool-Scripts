This is a simple tool to do a really common operation, which is to take LANDIS output and put it back in the original projection of your input files. It takes a folder full of raster files with no projection, and one raster that has the projection you want your rasters to end up in. The only check is that it have the same number of columns and rows as your LANDIS output, but it should work with any of your input rasters. This could be any of your LANDIS input files, such as the ecoregions or initial communities file, or a mask used to align your other layers, etc.
