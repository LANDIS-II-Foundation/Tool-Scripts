This tool creates a one-cell NECN model with parameters given in the R script. 
Its main use is to explore the effects of different raster values, which are otherwise difficult to modify. The script writes one-cell raster files with a given value, and also allows for easy changing of some parameters such as initial communities or NECN initial values. 
If you clone this repository, everything should run right out of the box if you open the .RProj file and run the script from inside RStudio. Otherwise, you may have to set the working directory manually to the directory including the R script.
Hopefully the .R file is well documented enough to follow along, but let me know if you have issues with it or any of the features it has. 

Thanks!
