# Tool-Scripts
A repository for scripts that anyone can contribute.

# Rules
All scripts are provided without any implied quality or support.  They can become outdates or libraries become deprecated or maybe you just like them.  That's fine.

# How Can You Contribute?

We encourage to share and don't worry about whether this works for anyone else.  Don't feel obligated to make it beautiful and transferrable to other people or projects.  Just consider:  If it was useful to you, it could be useful to someone else.  That's all.

First, fork the repository.  Next, make changes or add your scripts to a new folder. Commit the changes and push the commits to your fork.  Then do a 'Pull Request,' and we'll pull the changes from your fork into the main repository.  It's that easy!

After you submit your Pull Request, we will review it and make sure that you didn't delete anything.  That is the only QA that we will perform.

Thanks for contributing!

Rob and Sam
