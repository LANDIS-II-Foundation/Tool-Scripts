# Tool-Scripts
A repository for scripts that anyone can contribute.

# Rules
All scripts are provided without any implied quality or support.  They can become outdated or libraries become deprecated, and you shouldn't feel any pressure to come spruce them up or provide support. Please add scripts or tools in any language you use. 


We encourage you to share and not to worry about whether your script or tool works for anyone else.  Don't feel obligated to make it beautiful and transferrable to other people or projects.  Just consider:  If it was useful to you, it could be useful to someone else.  That's all.

# How Can You Contribute?

First, fork the repository. If you use GitHub Desktop, you can clone the repository to your computer. Or, you can just make a new file in your browser and paste the script in. Next, make changes or add your scripts to a new folder. Commit the changes and push the commits to your fork.  Then do a 'Pull Request,' and we'll pull the changes from your fork into the main repository.  It's that easy!

After you submit your Pull Request, we will review it and make sure that you didn't delete anything.  That is the only QA that we will perform.

Thanks for contributing!
