These scripts download climate data in the format needed by the climate library: averages across each ecoregion. They rely on the USGS geoknife package, which uses remote servers to do all the processing and returns you tabular data that we can then rework into the right format. At the moment, the scripts only do one climate region, but when I add the functionality to do multiple ecoregions I'll update here. For now hopefully it's not too onerous to run the script a few times for each ecoregion.
